<h1>National Park FAQS:</h1>
<dl>
    <dt>How many national parks are there in total in the United States?</dt>
    <dd>There are currently 63 national parks in the United States. The most recently established national park is New River Gorge National Park, located in West Virginia. The National Park System includes 423 national park sites in total. These sites include memorials, national historic landmarks, heritage areas, etc. Most of the national parks are located in the western United States, in states such as California, Utah and Colorado. </dd>
    <dt>Which national parks are the most interesting and beautiful to visit?</dt>
    <dd>We think that every national park is worth visiting. However, there are some national parks that are most unique in the world due to their geography. To get the best national park experience we recommend visiting the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Zion, and Arches National Parks in the Western United States. Within the Eastern United States, the most famous ones are Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, and Everglades. Check out our national park trip itineraries in different regions to get the best experience.</dd>
    <dt>Which national parks have the most visitors?</dt>
    <dd>The parks with the most overnight visitors are: Grand Canyon, Yosemite & Yellowstone. However, several national parks have only “day” visitors, making the national park feels empty during the evening and night. For national parks with a higher amount of overnight visitors we recommend making lodging and camping reservations in advance.</dd>
    <dt>In which national parks can I observe/see the most wild animals?</dt>
    <dd class="">All national parks have wildlife from snakes and birds to larger animals, such as wolves, bears, moose and buffalo. To see the most wildlife we always recommend the National Parks that cover large forest areas such as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Isle Royale, Rocky Mountain or Alaska’s Denali National Park. Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is often referred to as the Serengeti of America because of its abundance of wildlife.
    </dd>
    <dt>Are there guided tours available? If so, any themed tours, such as wildlife, scenery, flowers, ect.?</dt>
    <dd class="">Yes, each national park offers guided tours that can either be hosted by the National Park Service or by certified guides. The National Park Service mission includes to educate visitors about the uniqueness of each different park. To find those guided tours it is best to go to the visitor center or research for certified guides in gateway towns.</dd>
    <dt>How many people come to visit each year?</dt>
    <dd class="">Last year there were 327 million national park visits in the United States. National Parks in the United States see a slow growth of national park visitation overall. Some national parks, like Zion, can become overcrowded during warmer months and require visitors to use park transportation rather than personal vehicles. Therefore, we recommend seasonal visitation during off-season months.</dd>
    <dt>Are there general rules when visiting a national park or does each park have specific ones?</dt>
    <dd class="">Yes, there are general rules when visiting national parks and you will find this information under the official website. Also, each national park has specific rules that can change seasonally. For example, the rule of making a campfire may depend on drought conditions and the risk of wildfires.</dd>
    <dt>Where can I find a map of all parks and specific parks?</dt>
    <dd class="">We think the best way to see all national parks on a map is to use the Find Your Park website provided by the NPS. Many national parks have the official park map for downloads.</dd>
    <dt>How do I make reservations for camping or staying in national parks?</dt>
    <dd class="">Most of the campsites in national parks and national forests are on a first-come first serve basis, however there is also the opportunity to make reservations online. We highly recommend making online reservations for popular national parks at least 3-5 months in advance.</dd>
    <dt>Can I drive into a national park? If so, do I need to pre-order an entrance ticket? </dt>
    <dd class="">Most of the national parks in the United States are accessible by car, RV or bus. You can always enter a park and pay the individual fee at the park entrance. The fees vary between $20-$40 per vehicle and can be valid between 2 – 7 days. If you combine various national parks we recommend you buy the America the Beautiful Pass for $80.</dd>
